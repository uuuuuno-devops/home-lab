## Other

### Proxmox

Each of my virtualization servers has at least 2 Gigabit network cards. I have allocated 2 separate vlans. The first is for cluster management, replication, etc. And the second one is for virtualized servers.

### Network

I have a network with a bandwidth of 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). I plan to upgrade my current router to a Mikrotik RB1100AHx2. I am impressed by the features and functionality of Mikrotik router for the price that they offer.

Currently, I have three virtual networks: 1) management 2) servers 3) other. Each of these networks is isolated from the others.
